           <p>Mini tennis is for children aged 5 to 10 years old and is the
         very foundation of our junior programme. Mini tennis is played
         on scaled down courts and has three stages of progression: mini
          red, mini orange and mini green. Mini red is for children aged 5 to
           8 years old, mini orange is for children aged 9, and mini green
            is for children aged 10. Each stage has its own court size and
             type of ball. We have a large mini tennis coaching programme
             that involves both group and individual coaching.</p>

    <div class="panel-body collapse" id="collapseGroupCoaching">
      <p>The majority of our junior membership has group coaching. Children
        aged 11 and over move on from mini tennis balls to the standard yellow
         balls and train on a full-sized court. Group coaching is popular
          with children because they both learn and meet friends at the same
           time. When a child takes up the game for the first time, the best
            way to start is in a group with players of similar standard.</p>

      <p>For the most rapid progress possible, one-to-one lessons are the

           works well – plus it splits the cost.</p>
