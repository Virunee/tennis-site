      <p class="well"><strong>'Tennis for everyone’</strong> is our motto. We have playing standards to suit every type of player, from beginner to Essex League standard. Most of the best players in the area play at our club, and we also have programmes that cater for adult beginners as well as programmes for children as young as fives years old. We cover the whole spectrum.</p>
      <p>Westliff Hard is perhaps most famous for being the club where the Lloyd brothers spent their formative years as players. David, John and Tony Lloyd all played at Wimbledon in the 1970s and are indeed still members of Westcliff Hard today.</p>
