         to Essex League standard. Most of the best players in the area play
         at our club, and we also have programmes that cater for adult
          beginners as well as programmes for children as young as fives
          years old. We cover the whole spectrum.</p>
      <p>Westliff Hard is perhaps most famous for being the club where
         the Lloyd brothers spent their formative years as players.
          David, John and Tony Lloyd all played at Wimbledon in the
           1970s and are indeed still members of Westcliff Hard today.</p>
